## 🧠 How DOe Works (Core Logic)

1. User inputs lifestyle/symptom values via sliders.  
2. Each slider is linked to **dosha weightage**.  
3. Engine processes the values via a custom formula.  
4. Output is visualized as:
   - Numerical score  
   - Trend graph  
   - Dosha dominance indicator  

> **Example:** A user selects *3 hours sleep*, the system increases **Vata** and lowers **Kapha**, adjusting the final oscillation score.
